# Refactor-Challenge-
## Description

This is my understanding of refactoring div into semantic. 

    My inspiration for this is to try and understand the difference between div and semantic
    I refactored this program mainly on css because css is a simpler way to indentify similar content and go group them together. I have yet to understand the core concept of refactoring div into symantic formant in html. I honestly still have no idea how to refactor div into html on the basis that I have a very shallow understanding of attributes and elements. My lack of understanding in uses and how to position them. I.e head vs. header. If you ask me to explain the difference, I would not be able to answer it. Now if we implement symbols to represent elements/attributes, i'm already lost because I have no idea what i'm talking about. 
    It made simplifying code a lot easier by removing excess unecessary code when I could figure out what the code was about based on playing with the px size, editing or removing segments of the code, or editing... words.... classes...? 

    Please send help!
